## Aim :dart:

#### To Create a Notepad Application with tkinter

## Purpose :thinking:

- This Project helps us understanding how to combine both tkinter and file operations in our code.

## Description :bookmark_tabs:

- Every programmer uses notepad or any version of notepad to excute his/her piece of code and get the output.

- But the only few have an idea what is the technology behind the application, hence our project give a basic idea how a notepad works.

- Our code build by using basics of python and also a basic module knows as tkinter module.


- Modules imported are:
     
     1.`tkinter` 
    
     2.`askopenfilename, asksaveasfilename from tkinter.filedialog`

## Working :computer:

- First import `tkinter` module.
- Now after importing the tkinter now import `askopenfilename, asksaveasfilename from tkinter.filedialog`.
- Functions used for the code are as follows:
    1. `def open_file():`
       
        - This function is used to open an another saved file into our notepad we have 3 options.
         
          - default as `.txt file`
         
          - text file as `.txt file`
         
          - python file as `.py`
    
    2. `def save_file():`
       
         - This function is used to save the written code into our pc intially we have 3 options.
        
           - default as `.txt file`
        
           - text file as `.txt file`
        
           - python file as `.py file`
        

## Points to remember while working with the code :bookmark:

1. Download the code either with `.py extension` or `.ipynb extension`.
2. Make sure you have tkinter installed otherwise use `pip install tkinter`.
3. Now run the file since its tkinter module youll get a window as shown in the below output picture.
4. Now your Notepad is ready you can type **python files or text files** in the notepad and save it with there respective extensions but if you havent specified the extension by **default it will take as text file.**
5. For opening a saved file click open button inorder to open a preloaded file in to your notepad **only text and python files**.
